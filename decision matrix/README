# Decision Matrix for Privacy-Preserving ML Frameworks

This directory contains `decision_matrix.csv`, a practitioner-oriented comparison of major Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) frameworks and techniques evaluated in the paper:

**_Benchmarking the Practical Adoption of Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning:  
A Tool-Centric and Framework-Oriented Review (2017–2025)_**

---

## Purpose

The decision matrix helps practitioners and researchers compare PPML frameworks across:

- **Threat coverage** (membership inference, inversion, extraction, poisoning, gradient leakage)
- **Techniques** (DP, FL, SMPC, HE, hybrid patterns)
- **Maturity** (research prototype → production-ready)
- **Usability** (developer friction, ecosystem integration)
- **Scalability** (suitability for large models or distributed workloads)
- **Performance characteristics**
- **Real-world adoption**
- **Provenance** (data source: experiments, docs, literature)

This matrix is **not** an automated ranking — it is a structured reference to support engineering decisions.

##  File included

### `decision_matrix.csv`

Columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `framework` | Name of PPML framework or technique. |
| `category` | DP / FL / SMPC / HE / Hybrid. |
| `threat_covered` | Which privacy/security risks this framework mitigates. |
| `maturity` | High / Medium / Emerging level of readiness. |
| `usability` | Developer experience, ease of integration. |
| `scalability` | Suitability for large-scale or distributed training. |
| `performance_notes` | Overheads, runtime implications, relevant constraints. |
| `real_world_adoption` | How widely it is used beyond academia. |
| `provenance` | *paper_run*, *literature*, *tool_doc*, or *repo_link*. |
| `example_reference` | URL or citation for validation. |

---

##  Provenance codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `paper_run` | Values measured directly through experiments in this repo. |
| `literature` | Derived from academic papers or authoritative surveys. |
| `tool_doc` | Values taken from official framework documentation. |
| `repo_link` | Derived from external implementations or reference repos. |

This helps reviewers validate transparency.

## 🔧 Extending the Matrix

To add a new framework:

1. Add a row to `decision_matrix.csv`.  
2. Provide accurate `provenance`.  
3. Optionally link a benchmark or note under `performance_notes`.  
4. Submit a pull request (see root `CONTRIBUTING` section).

##  Relation to the Paper

This matrix corresponds to content in the following sections:

- **Threat-to-Defense Mapping**
- **Framework Landscape**
- **Practitioner Decision Tree**
- **Guidelines for Deployment**

It is meant to **complement** the figures and analysis, not replace them.
